# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control

This Hand Gesture Volume Control project introduces a futuristic and intuitive way to manage your computer's audio using only hand gestures. By combining real-time computer vision with machine learning, this application enables users to adjust system volume without any physical contactâ€”just by moving their fingers.

Utilizing a webcam for live video input, the system tracks the distance between the thumb and index finger to determine volume levels. It leverages a powerful tech stack:

1. OpenCV for image processing

2. MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and gesture recognition

3. PyAutoGUI to simulate keyboard inputs and control system volume

This seamless integration results in a highly responsive, interactive experience that enhances accessibility and redefines how users engage with their devices.
